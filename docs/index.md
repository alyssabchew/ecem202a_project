# Abstract

For our project, we aimed to create a smart home system as well as a system of smart plugs to allow the user to simply turn lights and other products on and off with simple gestures. In order to measure our success, we chose to evaluate the final system based on how well different gestures were successfully recognized and how well those gestures triggered the expected events (turning lights on and off).  We used existing work from AprilTags, ARKit and gesture recognition as the foundation of our algorithm to accomplish our goals.  We implemented ARKit to recognize a user's position and orientation as well as AprilTags to uniquely identify different elements around the space and the user's relative position and orientation to those objects.  We also utilized machine learning and gesture recognition to allow users to turn smart plugs on and off without having to stand up or use their voice.  Results are somewhat promising since our system is sometimes able to recognize gestures and correctly turn lights on and off.  However, our system can be improved with additional automation of the AprilTag recognition between the iPhone and MATLAB as well as the improvement of gesture recognition within a specified range.  Our system does have a latency issue and tends to respond quite slowly at times to the gestures and requires the devices to be quite close to the smart home plugs.  We see this work as a potential first step to create a more complex system that would allow anyone who does not want to have to verbally communicate with their smart home the same accessibility as those who are currently asking Alexa or Google to complete tasks for them.
