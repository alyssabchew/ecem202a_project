# Abstract

Provide a brief overview of the project objhectives, approach, and results.

For our project, we aimed to create a smart home system as well as a system of smart plugs to allow the user to simply turn lights and other products on and off with simple gestures. In order to measure our success, we chose to evaluate the final system based on how well different gestures were successfully recognized and how well those gestures triggered the expected events (turning lights on and off).  We used existing work from AprilTags, ARKit and gesture recognition as the foundation of our algorithm to accomplish our goals.  We implemented ARKit to recognize a user's position and orientation as well as AprilTags to uniquely identify different elements around the space and the user's relative position and orientation to those objects.  We also utilized machine learning and gesture recognition to allow users to turn smart plugs on and off without having to stand up or use their voice.  Results are promising since our system is often able to recognize gestures and correctly turn lights on and off.  However, our system can be improved with additional automation of the AprilTag recognition between the iPhone and MATLAB as well as the improvement of gesture recognition within a specified range.  We see this work as a potential first step to create a more complex system that would allow anyone who does not want to have to verbally communicate with their smart home the same accessibility as those who are currently asking Alexa or Google to complete tasks for them. 

# 1. Introduction

This section should cover the following items:

* Motivation & Objective: What are you trying to do and why? (plain English without jargon)
* State of the Art & Its Limitations: How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* Novelty & Rationale: What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
* Potential Impact: If the project is successful, what difference will it make, both technically and broadly?
* Challenges: What are the challenges and risks?
* Requirements for Success: What skills and resources are necessary to perform the project?
* Metrics of Success: What are metrics by which you would check for success?

Most current smart home systems are focused on voice recognition and voice commands.  Those who are hearing impaired struggle to use such devices since they cannot interact with Alexa, Siri, or Google Home is quite the same way.  Therefore, we attempted to bridge this gap by creating a system that would afford people with hearing impairments the same ease and convenience with smart devices as people who can hear.
